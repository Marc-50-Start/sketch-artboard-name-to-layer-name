## Sketch Plugins

**prependArtboardNameToLayerName.sketchplugin** prepends the Artboard name (eg. a path) to all the Layers it contains. It does that for all Artboards in your Sketch file.

**removeArtboardNameFromLayerName.sketchplugin** removes the Artboard name from all Layers. It does that for all Artboards in your Sketch file.
